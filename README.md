Project development TPJ 

<h1>Introduction</h1>
The main objective of the discipline of TPJ is choose a game to develop the patterns that we learn in the class. <br>
I choose tetris, because i wanted to know how it works, due when i was young i played this game so many times. 

<h1>Layout game</h1>
The game Tetris has hold piece (when we want to use current piece for later), score info, lines clear, level, next piece, falling piece and grid for playing (display proposes) <br>
---put image of the layout of the program  <br>
The grid has 10 rows for 20 columns <br>
The length of the piece is 4 <br>
